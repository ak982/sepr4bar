You sit down in the cold metal chair.
In front of you is a massive control panel.
Dials whirl without sense,
and lights flash on and off.
Most of them are red.

It's only you left.
Everyone on the outside is dead,
swallowed by the remains of the world.
Everyone you knew at least.
Maybe there are people left.
Some bastion of humanity perhaps.
Before you die, maybe you can do
one last act of good and wrestle
this power plant back into action.
Maybe some lost souls are out there,
and they need your help.

You lean forward and flip a switch.
This plant is, despite the wear and tear,
still new. The latest technology.
A trained person could run it indefinitely.
Unfortunately, you're not trained.

You hear a loud clang from somewhere,
followed by the sounds of automatic
machine gun fire. While it's just you,
all you have to contend with
is this dying plant.

But another player is entering the arena,
and they are hungry for you.
And when they get to you,
it's only a matter of time.
They destroyed the world,
and you're next.

The bunnies are approaching...
